The aim of this project is to create multiple machine learning regression models to predict the critical
temperature of the superconductors. 
Steps to do this task:
1. Create the Jupyter notebook on a Python 3.x kernel.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Pre-process the data (Exploratory Data Analysis).
4. Define the relevant independent variables for prediction of the critical
   temperature.
5. Construct the regression models.
6. Calculate the measure of accuracy / effectiveness of each of the models.
7. Select the one Regression Model from this model on the basis of accuracy.

The notebook should contain sufficient explanations of each step that you have
taken, and the underlying reasoning in order for it to be self-explanatory for
assessment.
